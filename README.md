📦 CRUD operations for seamless product management (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

⚛️ React.js frontend styled with a modern component library, Chakra UI

📱 Fully responsive design for an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices

🐞 Robust error handling and data validation to ensure data integrity

🌐 Deployment ready with separate configurations for the frontend and backend

🚀 A clean and scalable project structure that's easy to maintain and expand


🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Chakra UI, Vite

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose

Database: MongoDB
